    <br/>2. <i>Coffee Grinds</i> – Use your morning addiction to feed your gardening habit! Coffee grinds are considered a green compost material which is rich in nitrogen. Once the grounds break down, your soil will be fed with delicious nitrogen. An added benefit is increased drainage.
    <br/>3. <i>Plant Nitrogen-Fixing Plants</i> – Vegetables like peas, beans, and soybeans can increase nitrogen in your soil.
    <br/>4. Plant <i>Green Manure</i> crops like cabbage, corn, and broccoli.
    <br/>5. <i>Use Mulch (Wet Grass)</i> – Mulch can include sawdust and scrap softwoods.
    <br/>6. Add <i>Organic Matter</i> (like Straw or Leaves) to bind excess nitrogen and prevent leaching.
    <br/>7. <i>Ensure Proper Irrigation</i> – Be mindful not to over-water, as excessive watering can wash away excess nitrogen deeper into the soil.

    <br/>2. <i>Plant Heavy Nitrogen-Feeding Plants</i> – Tomatoes, corn, broccoli, cabbage, and spinach thrive off nitrogen and will help deplete the nitrogen in the soil.
    <br/>3. <i>Water</i> – Soaking your soil with water will help leach the nitrogen deeper into your soil, leaving less for your plants.
    <br/>4. <i>Sugar</i> – Limited studies show that adding sugar to soil can reduce nitrogen levels. Sugar attracts nitrogen like sawdust or woodchips due to its carbon content.

"""
If all nutrients (N, P, K, pH, Soil Moisture) have the same difference, the order in which you would prioritize fixing them is:

1. Soil Moisture, because nutrients are water-soluble and must move through the soil solution to plant roots.
2. pH, because it strongly affects nutrient availability.
3. Nitrogen (N), because it is crucial for vegetative growth. It promotes strong leaf and stem growth.
4. Phosphorus (P), because it supports root development, flower and fruit production, and overall energy transfer in the plant.
5. Potassium (K), because it is essential for overall plant health, including water regulation, disease resistance, and the development of strong stems.
